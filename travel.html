        <p>Travel would give us relaxed time, peace of mind, original and creative thoughts.
          On the other hand, it sometimes could give you a scary moment. I will introduce you two travel sites of my trips.
        One gave me the most relaxed time whereas the other gave me the most frightening moment.</p>
      <!----  <p class="trip_cite">The BearTooth Highway, The Miraval Resort</p>---->
        <p>I got one of the most frightening moment in my life at the BearTooth highway
          and had one of the most peaceful and relaxed time in the Miraval Resot in Arizona.

        <h3>BearTooth Highway</h3>
        <img src="images/beartooth3.jpg" width=80% alt="">
        <p>The BearTooth Highway is one way to the Yellowstone, which goes to the NE entrance of Yellowstone.
        This highway is famous of its spetacular and fantastic scnery while dangerous roads.
        It opens only summer usually between late May and late September.
        The time when I was planning to go to Yellowston was August. And, I was curious and thought
        that I could go if everybody was okay. I found it was a stupid arrogant decision later.</p>
         <p>I took the above picture in August, in the middle of the summer.</p>
         <p>At first, the road was not too bad and trip was smooth. However, soon after the road
           was getting stiff and the road was getting narrow.
           Also, I was able to see the deep down cliff just below my eyes.
           My hands were damp with sweat and my heart was pounding so loudly.
           I couldn't even breathe properly. </p>
          <p>Fianlly, when I got the summit, I was so glad.
            The way down to the other side was not so bad.</p>

         <p>Was it beautiful? <i>Absolutely!</i></p>
         <p>Do I want to drive my car on the BearTooth Highway again? <i>No, No, No!</i></p>

        <p>The Miraval Resort is in Arizona, where Sonoram Desert is.
          This resort was acquired by Hyatt a few years ago.
        And it is famous for no-tip, healthy food, and various activities
        including desert hikings or meditations.
        </p>

        <p>You can enjoy healthy food and join Yoga or meditation class.

        <p>It can be pricy, but if you use member points of Hyatt or other cards,
          you can enjoy this fantastic resort with a small amount of money.
          Most of all, this resort takes no-tip policy. </p>
